"""Span overlap resolution.

The multi-pass detector (regex packs, Presidio NER, LLM-NER) produces a flat list of
:class:`~app.schemas.entities.EntitySpan` objects that may overlap or nest. ``merge_spans``
reduces that to a clean, start-sorted, non-overlapping list by picking a single winner for
each overlapping cluster.

Pure, no I/O, no optional dependencies.
